            The following is a list of the top 100 most famous poems of all time in the English language.  There's always room for debate when creating a "top 100" list, and let's face it, fame is a pretty fickle thing.  It changes over time.  But that said, we did our best to use available objective data in putting together this ranked list of the 100 most widely recognized and enduring poems ever written.  To create this list, the following criteria was used: 1) Only poems that have "stood the test of time" were considered.  Therefore, modern poetry of the last century was not included. 2) Each poem's ranking is based on its relative fame within the English language. 3) In order to create more even ground for comparison, we have not included in this list nursery rhymes, or poems whose fame was primarily gained from being set to music.
